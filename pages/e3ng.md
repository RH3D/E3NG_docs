# E3NG (ENDER 3 NG)
{: .text-center }

**Take your old, unused Creality Ender 3 and turn it into something amazing—something fast, powerful, precise, and reliable and enjoy the new level of tinkering.**
{: .text-center }

E3NG is a DIY project focused on reviving up to **78%*** of parts from your original printer and giving them a brand-new purpose. Many of us started with the simple Ender 3, and it taught us a lot—but 3D printing has evolved, and it’s time to step up. That’s exactly what this conversion is all about.

Originally designed for the Ender 3 Pro, it also supports other models like the V2, Neo, and even the non-Pro variant. The goal? Reuse as much as possible and build a machine that’s significantly faster, more reliable, easy to enclose, and still totally upgradable—because let’s face it, no one with an Ender 3 is done tinkering.

Whether you go with a low-budget build or max out performance, you’ll turn your Ender 3 into a CoreXY machine that honors its roots—while bringing it into the next generation of printers.

There are two versions to choose from:
 - **v1.2S (standard)** offers a more streamlined, kit-style approach with clear instructions and a straightforward build path—perfect if you prefer to keep things more simple.
 - **v1.2 (advanced)** is for those who like to go deep into the project, tweak every detail, giving you the flexibility to configure your printer to match your own preferences and setup.

# SELF SOURCING
{: .text-center }

If you are not interested in buying the complete kit, feel free to source all the parts by yourself and possibly even reuse some other parts laying around.

The links in the Bill of material are for products that have been tested and are of required quality for succesfull build.

{: .warning }
Remember that the BOM covers all the required parts needed for the conversion but depending on your preferred setup, you might need aditional parts like hotend, extruder, probe etc.

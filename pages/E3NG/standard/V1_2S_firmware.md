# FIRMWARE
{: .text-center }

To run the printer and start printing, we need to set up the Firmware.

For extremely fast printing, more advanced tuning and high-end features, it is recommended to use [Klipper FW].

For the simplicity of the printer and saving some resources while still being able to print pretty fast and taking advantage of most of the advanced features, you can install [Marlin FW].

To learn how to install the firmware, it is recommended to search their official websites along with the motherboard manufacturer github (if available) for the most up to date information. It is also helpful to follow other available guides on YouTube or some discussion websites.

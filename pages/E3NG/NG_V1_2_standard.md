# E3NG v1.2S
{: .text-center }
#### v1.2S = standard version (kit-based)
{: .text-center }

The v1.2S variant of the E3NG platform is intended for users who prioritize clarity and a streamlined assembly process. This configuration offers a guided path toward transforming an Ender 3 (Pro, V2, Neo, or non-Pro) into a CoreXY machine without the complexity of open-ended customization. It has been specifically designed to reduce the sourcing burden through predefined kits, simplified documentation, and a well-tested selection of partsâ€”allowing users to focus on assembly and performance tuning rather than studying all the advanced options and their compatibility.

This version includes structured instructions, a standardized Bill of Materials, and multiple kit options covering either full builds or partial upgrades. You can download the version specific package of printable parts and even firmware files. The mechanical and motion platform remains the same as in the advanced variant, so it is easy to perform upgrades later, once you get familiar with the printer.

While customization is possible post-build, the v1.2S prioritizes user experience and accessibility, making it an excellent entry point into the E3NG ecosystem for those new to CoreXY systems or those seeking a dependable upgrade path from the classic Ender 3 design.

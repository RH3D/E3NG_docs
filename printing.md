# MATERIAL SELECTION
### ABS/ASA
This is the most recommended and best choice material for the printed parts.
### PETG
Is more flexible which will reduce stiffness of the frame. It has lower temperature resistance so enclosing the printer may
affect the printer and will most likely lead to some warped parts (toolhead, bed carriage) unless you print at lower
temperatures (PLA, PETG) or take precautions like bed insulation.
### PLA
Can be used on an open frame printer but not with an enclosure as the parts would definitely warp. The toolhead and bed
carriage should still be printer with higher temp resistant material.
To follow my recommended color scheme, look at the BOM list – every file is marked as A (accent) or M (main) color but
be creative and make your own scheme and design.

# PRINTING INSTRUCTIONS
All files are already properly oriented for printing.
Some of the printed parts require 235x235 mm print area to fit the build plate. Ender 3 printers offer that but you may
have to change your built plate size in slicer (including the avoid zones).
Recommended printing with:
4 perimeters
5 top and bottom layers
30% infill
0.2 mm layer height
No supports needed (there are some already build into the models)
With recommended settings you will need around 1750 g of filament.
Files are available at my printables profile – see the first page.

# CALIBRATION PRINT AND TOLERANCES
Before printing the parts, it is highly recommended to print the calibration cube. It contains essential features that are
related to the project parts like holes for 12/8mm rods, holes for heat inserts etc. All the parts are designed with rather
tighter tolerances (.2mm) on important areas like linear rods, this may cause some printers have too tight fit, if this is the
case, you can clear the holes with a 8mm/12mm drill bit or a piece of fine-grit sandpaper on a round stick. Just proceed
carefully so you don’t enlarge the holes too much as it would lead to inaccuracies.
Link to the calibration cube is on the first page.

# ABS PRINTING TIPS
ABS/ASA is the best choice for the build, but it is a material, that is not easy to print on an openframe bedslingers and it
may be very challenging for many users. Here are some print tips:
1. Use enclosure! - best and most effective, even if you use some temporary solution to help stabilise the printer
surrounding and increase the ambient air around.
2. Use draft shield - without enclosure, draft shield will help to separate the cold fresh air from the part itself. Draft
shield may help even in enclosure when the air temperature is not as high.
3. Clean the build plate - my best method is to use the hard side of sponge with warm water and dish soap.
4. Clamp your build plate - for magnetic flexible build plates. Bigger prints still tend to warp slightly even in enclosure
unless it is really hot. This may lead to lifting corners of the build plate and thus warped parts. Clamp the
edges/corners of the build plate to the bed.
5. Use brim to stick the parts better to the bed.
6. Less is more - play with the print settings, you may need to decrease the fan speed and/or print speed.
7. More is more - you may need to increase the hotend temperature to properly melt the filament and get rid of its
internal tension. You may need to increase the bed temperature for better sticking parts and hotter environment
for the print.
8. Use ABS+, ASA or different brand - some filaments are more prone to warping, ASA overall tends to warp less. Do
your research or testing to find better filament for you that can warp less.
9. Use adhesive - if your parts still don't stick to the surface, use some kind of bed adhesive suitable for ABS.
Have a look at the mods and alternative parts, there is option to use aluminium extrusions to avoid printing the
rear vertical beams. Also there is a mod for using metal bed carriage plate to avoid printing the big center part and
add stiffness to the bed carriage.

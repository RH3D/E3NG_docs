## WHAT IS ENDER 3 NG?

This project is a DIY conversion originaly based on Creality Ender 3 Pro. The original Ender 3 was one of the most sold printers but due to its lack of modern features, it is rather a starting point for people who either can't afford to buy a more expensive machine or don't want to spend money on something they just want to try.

That is a reason why many want to move forward and the old and simple Ender 3 don't have much use anymore, especially with the printers that are on market these days.

Main goal of this project is to use the old Ender 3, tear it apart and reuse as many stock parts as possible to build something that is on a whole different level and on par with the modern machines you see everywhere now. The new printer must be more reliable, faster, having more great features and capabilities and options for further upgrades (honestly, who coming here with an Ender 3 isn't looking for upgrades?).

It is based on CoreXY motion system, is easy to enclose and you can do a cheap and simple build or you can go crazy and build a real bonkers machine.

Of course, you also need aditional parts for the conversion.

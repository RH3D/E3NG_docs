# What are it's advantages?
Reuse.

This project is a DIY conversion based on Ender 3 Pro. Ender 3 is one of the most sold printers but it is a starting printer so
many want to move forward after using it for some time and don’t have much use for it anymore.
Main goal was to use as many useful parts from stock Ender as possible while making a very reliable printer with many
great features and possible upgrades. This means that you can rebuild the printer with some effort very cheap and get a
very capable coreXY machine but also that you can do many upgrades to get almost high-end printer capable of printing
fast, high quality and even high temp materials.

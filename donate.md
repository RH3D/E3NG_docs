# SUPPORT MY WORK
{: .text-center }

Ender 3 NG will always be free to use, but developing a project of this size, variability and compatibility is a huge amount of work, it takes lot of time, effort and requires resources to test and improve the design and maintain it up to date.

If you decide to directly support my work and help cover the cost of the project and other future plans, you can use some of the following links.

You can also do so by using affiliate links in the BOM or through the [feedback] which also helps with no added cost to you.

#### Thank you a lot!

Ender 3 NG will always be free to use, but developing a project of this size, variability and compatibility is a huge amount of work, it takes lot of time, effort and requires resources to test and improve the design.

If you decide to support my work and help cover the cost of the project and other future plans, you can use some of the following links. Also using affiliate links in the BOM helps a bit with no added cost to you.

Thank you a lot!

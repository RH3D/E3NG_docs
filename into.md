It is highly recommended to first start with the stock project and then if you want to, start looking at user mods, but absolutely feel free to choose the path you like the best.
Most remixes and mods are posted on [Printables remixes] but you will also find other on the Discord server. There are also many [remixes for the beta] version and majority of them will still be compatible.

# PROJECT OPTIONS
{: .text-center }
Going deeper into the project, you will find that not all the printers are build the same, that is because the project is offering various options to configure it to your liking right from the start.
Ender 3 NG started as a cheap coreXY conversion for Creality Ender 3 Pro, it has been in the beta version and available to public over a year and while others have been building the printers, I have been listening to all the feedback and getting to know the real preferences from users.

As a result the project has some options to choose from to suit your preferences the best.

To view all the options and help with the configuration, head to the [Printer configuration].

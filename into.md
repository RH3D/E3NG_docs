# INTO THE PROJECT
{: .text-center }
So you have come all the way here, that probably means you really want to dive into the project.
Let's start with the important links to get all the files and details you need for the project.

[Printables]{: .btn .text-yellow-000 .v-align-middle } - To download the STL files. Files there will always be up to date.

[CONFIGURATOR]{: .btn .text-yellow-100 .v-align-middle } - To get the Bill of Material, the actual list of printed parts and some other details.

[Join the Discord]{: .btn .text-yellow-200 .v-align-middle } - To search for help, be part of the community and see what others have built.

[Join the Discord]{: .btn .text-yellow-300 .v-align-middle } - To search for help, be part of the community and see what others have built.

[Support my work]{: .btn .v-align-middle } - If you want to directly support the project.

To view some general content about the project, head to main [Instagram] or [YouTube].

It is highly recommended to first start with the stock project and then if you want to, start looking at user mods, but absolutely feel free to choose the path you like the best.
Most remixes and mods are posted on [Printables remixes] but you will also find other on the Discord server.

# PROJECT OPTIONS
{: .text-center }
Going deeper into the project, you will find that not all the printers are build the same, that is because the project is offering various options to configure the setup from the start.
Ender 3 NG started as a cheap coreXY conversion for Creality Ender 3 Pro, it has been in the beta version and available to public over a year and while others have been building the printers, I have been listening to all the feedback and getting to know the real preferences from users.

As a result the project has some options to choose from to suit your preferences the best.

To view all the options and help with the configuration, head to the [Printer configuration].

**WHAT DOES THE FREE PROJECT INCLUDE?**
- STL files for printing the parts, BOM, printer details and build manual.

**WHAT ABOUT CAD FILES?**
- See #ðŸ“¢_announcement for link to those.

**HOW MUCH DOES THE CONVERSION COST?**
- If you are using as much as you can of the Ender 3 and assuming you have a capable motherboard (32bit? - need to test 8bit yet) then the recommended BOM will cost you around 200$ minimum, but there are optional parts/mods that can add to the cost. This doesn't include filament to print the parts.

**HOW MUCH FILAMENT DO I NEED?**
- 1750g with recommended printing parameters.

**WHAT TYPE OF FILAMENT SHOULD I USE?**
- For filament recommendations and print instructions, please look at the build manual.

**WHY DIDN'T YOU USE LINEAR RAILS?**
     1) Keeping the cost lower.
     2) Accessibility of the parts?
     3) Performance and reliability - linear rods are well tested and proved to work great (eg. Prusa, Bambu Lab or Creality K1).
     4) Possibility of upgrading to carbon rods if speed and weight is the main factor.

**WILL IT GET KLIPPER?**
- I think Marlin is very capable with good board and has all the needed high end features. I currently prefer to have a standalone printer without need for another boards or pc but I plan to give Klipper a try. There are also Klipper config files from other members.

**WILL I DESTROY MY ENDER 3?**
- No, this conversion will improve your Ender 3 in probably every way. If you decide to convert it just make sure and check at least twice that you have everything ready and that you understand what you are going to do. If you still decide that you liked your Ender 3 more than Ender 3 NG don't worry, the project is designed so that you don't need to cut or drill anything and you can go back easily.

# SOURCING PARTS
{: .text-center }

This page is under construction.

Should I self source all the parts or get a kit?
You have both options and both have it's advantages and disadvantages, let's look at it closer.

# SELF SOURCING
{: .text-center }
It is a great way to utilise all your spare parts and thus save some money but also to absolutely customise the printer to your liking, with the BOM configurator, you will choose all the options you like and don't need to buy anything extra. You can choose where to buy, wait for sales etc.
If you decide to selfsource, remember to read the BOM carefully and make sure you understand the needs of specific parts if you are not just following the links.

# KITS
{: .text-center }
Offering kits for the build is a great way to save your time with sourcing parts separately and to decrease the chance of missing parts because kits have what is needed and are tested by other users. To that said, no kit is created equal and you have to be carefull as well. With reputable brands like ******* or ******, you know to be in the good hands and can be sure that these kits are prepared well and have quality parts. But there are also kits that haven't been consulted with me at all and I would be really carefull here. There have been cases of poor quality parts or missing parts which shouldn't happen with verified kits, because the lowest price is not the nr.1 priority, it is the balance between cost and quality and for crucial parts, I really insist to have decent quality.

You can find all the verified kits in the Configurator - Verifier kits list.

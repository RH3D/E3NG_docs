# PRECAUTIONS

This project has been out for over a year in the first public beta version which gave back impressive amount of feedback, testing, updating and inspiraton. Thanks to that the design choices could have been greatly tested and updated upon that but still, even after that, there are many variables and changes and it is not within my power to properly test every possible combination, hotend, probe, cooling solution etc.. although reviewing community builds is a great tool for that so if you 

With so many variables in the project, there must be some conflicts, most of them are marked in the CONFIGURATOR but here, you will have more details about all the possible issues.

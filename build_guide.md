<p>2025.01.16 - Fixed pg.73 (2040 x 400 mm extrusion) and pg.74 DA=DB (~575 mm)</p>
<p>2024.10.30 - Initial public release</p>
</details>

The current version includes the base printer build with it's variations.
It currently doesn't include the enclosure and some of the optional parts, these will come with a future update or a part 2 of the build guide, but don't worry, they are quite easy to assemble even without the build instructions.

Please keep in mind, this is the first public release so it might not be perfect for everyone, but it should be usefull for everyone - for every configuration possible. If needed, take your time, read everything and slowly go through the steps to get to know the build process and really understand how it all goes together.

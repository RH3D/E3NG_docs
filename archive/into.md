It is highly recommended to first start with the stock project so you will follow the clear path, get complete and right instructions and lists and then start modifying with user mods if you want to.
Most remixes / mods are posted on [Printables remixes] but you will also find other on the Discord server. There are also many [remixes for the beta] version and majority of them will still be compatible.

# PROJECT OPTIONS
{: .text-center }
Going deeper into the project, you will find that not all the printers are build the same, that is because the project is offering various options to configure it to your liking right from the start.

Ender 3 NG started as a cheap coreXY conversion for Creality Ender 3 Pro, it has been in the beta version and available to public for over a year and while others have been building printers, I have been listening to all the feedback and getting to know other users preferences.

As a result the project has many options to choose from to suit your needs the best.

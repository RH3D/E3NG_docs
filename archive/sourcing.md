# SOURCING PARTS
{: .text-center }

You have generaly two options to buy your parts - source them yourself with the help of BOM or buy a kit. Both of them have advantages and disadvantages.

# SELF SOURCING
{: .text-center }
Is a great way to utilise all your spare parts and save some money but also to absolutely customise the printer to your preferences. With the BOM configurator, you will choose all the options you like and you don't need to buy anything extra. You can also choose where to buy individual products, wait for sales and build or upgrade the printer in stages.

If you decide to selfsource, remember to read the BOM carefully and make sure you understand the needs of specific parts if you are not just following the links.

Bill of material also mentions most of the important parameters for almost every part.

{: .warning }
There are many options to buy your parts with many being significantly cheaper than what is in the BOM. While it is tempting to spend less money, products in the BOM are recommended based on experience of me and many other users. Generally you want reasonable quality for motion system parts - linear shafts, bearings, belts, pulleys etc. You can buy cheaper parts but it is very likely that you will get parts with bad quality and consistency resulting in worse print quality, worse input shaper and overall performance and these will most certainly not last as long as quality products so you will need to spend extra money in time - tested, proven.

# KITS
{: .text-center }
Offering kits for the build is a great way to save your time and to decrease the chance of missing parts because kits have what is needed for the build and are tested by other users.

{: .warning }
No kit is created equal and you have to be carefull as well. With reputable brands like * * * or * * *, you know to be in good hands and you can be sure that these kits are well prepared and have quality parts. But there are also kits that haven't been consulted with me in any way and I would be really carefull here. Some users who bought them often received poorer quality parts or few missing parts which shouldn't happen with verified kits, because low price is not the only priority, it is the balance between cost and quality and for crucial parts, I really insist to have decent quality.

You can find all the verified kits with details and links in the Configurator.
